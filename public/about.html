<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Oyeintarimoboere Makpah but you can just call me Tari, for short. I am from Bayelsa state, Southern ijaw LGA, Amassoma.
  I am 5'10 i guess. I am a graduate from Niger Delta University where i studied pharmacy and obtained a degree in BPharm. So yeah, 
  i am a Pharmacist (proud much haha).
</p>

<p>I am from a family of 7. I have 4 siblings excluding me. 3 boys and 1 girl. My favorite sibling is my immediate younger brother, Miebi.
  I don't think he knows and i do not want him to either. Fun fact, i used to hate him so much while we were still little and i would tell
  God on different occasions to take him because he was so troublesome, disrespectful and stingy but here we are.
</p>

<p>I have few friends but i know a lot of people. I met some girls in the university who turned out to be my soul sisters and i will always 
  be grateful to God for them. I have a bestfriend that i have known for over 9 years now. Her name is Debbie and she is my safe space. God
  really did a thing by bringing her into my life. Oh lest i forget, i have a dog named Coco. She is my baby. I love her so much.
